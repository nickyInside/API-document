This is API documentation for uShipApp. I created with Swagger editor (http://swagger.io/). 

It displays all APIs which include uMan, uShip, uAnalyze, and uLog.
You can add, delete, and modify those APIs by Swagger editor.


To use Swagger editor locally:
(Make sure you have node.js installed)


1. open terminal
 

2. type this codes


git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor.git

cd swagger-editor

npm start


It build automatically and opens browser window.
